'''Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is an integer from 0 to 9, write a function rotate_image that receives a matrix as input and rotates the image by 90 degrees in the counter-clockwise direction.

Thoughts: 

[[1, 2, 3, 4],
 [5, 6, 7, 8],
 [9, 1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6, 7]]

Rotated 90 degrees clockwise

[[4, 9, 5, 1],
 [5, 1, 6, 2],
 [8, 2, 7, 3],
 [7, 3, 8, 4]]

 After a 90 degree rotatation, the first elements in each array become the first array, the second elements
 become the ordered elements in the second array etc etc.
