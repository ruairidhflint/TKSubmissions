## Draw/model out inserting a new element into a linked list with only one element.

First step, create a new instance of the node/item class with the value being the new value and 
the pointer pointing to None.

On the Linked List class, we currently only have one item. That means the head value on the linked
list should point to the one item in the list as well as the tail value. 
Assuming we are inserting a value on to the end of the linked list, we must do several things.
First, the new tail value of the list is our new Node.
Secondly, we access the head value (also the previous tail value) and change it's pointer from None
to our new Node.
